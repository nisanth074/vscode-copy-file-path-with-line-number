## FAQ

**Q:** The keyboard shortcut doesn't work on my machine

**A:** Press Cmd + Shift + p (Ctrl + Shift + p on Windows/Linux), search for "Copy current file full path with current line number" and press Enter. If it's successfully copies, a different extension may be overriding this keyboard shortcut. Search for the "Prefereces: Open Keyboard Shortcuts" command and map a keyboard shortcut of your liking to the "Copy current file full path with current line number" command.
